  <article>
    <p>Lord Shiva, also known as Mahadev, is one of the most revered deities in Hinduism. He is the destroyer and transformer among the Trimurti (Brahma - the creator, Vishnu - the preserver, Shiva - the destroyer). But Shiva is not just about destruction—he also symbolizes regeneration, deep meditation, and timeless wisdom.</p>

    <h2>🔱 The Many Forms of Shiva</h2>
    <p>Shiva appears in many forms: the peaceful yogi meditating in the Himalayas, the fierce warrior destroying evil, and the cosmic dancer Nataraja performing the divine dance of creation. Each form represents a different truth of the universe.</p>

    <h2>🌙 Symbols of Shiva</h2>
    <p>His third eye symbolizes higher perception. The crescent moon on His head marks control over time. The snake around His neck shows power over death and fear. The river Ganga flows from His hair, representing purity and life.</p>

    <h2>🕉️ Why Devotees Worship Him</h2>
    <p>People turn to Shiva for inner peace, strength, and liberation. Chanting "Om Namah Shivaya" is believed to cleanse the soul and connect one with the supreme consciousness. Shivaratri, His sacred night, is celebrated with fasting, prayers, and meditation.</p>

    <h2>📜 Stories from Puranas</h2>
    <p>Shiva drank the poison during the churning of the cosmic ocean to save the universe—turning His throat blue (Neelkanth). He married Goddess Parvati, symbolizing divine love and balance. Stories of His sons—Ganesha and Kartikeya—also carry deep spiritual meaning.</p>

    <h2>🛕 Shiva Temples</h2>
    <p>From Kedarnath in the Himalayas to Rameswaram in the South, Shiva temples are spread across India, each with unique legends. Visiting these places brings spiritual energy and inner calm.</p>
