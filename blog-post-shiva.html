    <p>The story starts at one night, That night world is in the full of darkness stars com close to the earth suddenly one and 23 years old man wake up in the bed. </p>

    <h2>The tragic incident </h2>
    <p>It was an ordinary night in a small town tucked between the hills. The world outside seemed silent, only the sound of crickets filling the air. A boy named Aarav was sleeping near the window of his room, when suddenly a strange brightness touched his eyelids. He thought it was just a dream. But when he opened his eyes, he froze.</p>

    
    <p>The stars were no longer distant specks in the sky. They were closer—so close that they looked like glowing lanterns hanging just above the rooftops. The sky shimmered with silver flames, and every shadow on the ground stretched long and sharp.</p>

    
    <p>At first, Aarav thought it was beautiful, almost magical. But within moments, the beauty turned terrifying. The air grew heavy, the temperature began to rise, and birds screamed in confusion as they flew aimlessly. People rushed out of their homes, pointing at the sky in disbelief.</p>

   
    <p>The scientists had no explanation. Some said the Earth’s magnetic field had shifted, dragging the stars unnaturally near. Others believed it was the beginning of the world’s end. Children cried, elders whispered prayers, and the air was thick with fear.</p>

    
    <p>Aarav, only 14, stood barefoot on the ground, staring at the glowing heavens. He whispered to himself, “Why me? Why am I awake to see this, when the rest of the world is still dreaming?”</p>

    <p>As the night deepened, the stars pulsed brighter, burning hotter. Trees began to wither, rivers steamed, and the sky looked like it was about to shatter. The once beautiful stars now carried the weight of tragedy—an omen that life on Earth might not see another dawn.</p>

    <p>But in the chaos, Aarav noticed something others did not. The stars seemed to be “calling”—their light blinking in patterns, like a code. Was it a warning? Was it a message? Or was it destiny that he, an ordinary boy, would be the only one to understand it?</p>

    <p>That night became the night the Earth could never forget: the night when the stars descended, and hope and fear walked hand in hand.</p>
